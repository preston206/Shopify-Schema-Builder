# Shopify Schema Builder

Like the name implies, this app is used for building Shopify schemas. You can generate code for individual schema types, like just a text input or just an image_picker, or you can build an entire schema with as many types as you want.

_The app can be found here: [Shopify Schema Builder](https://binarydesert.dev/shopify-schema-builder/)_

### A Few Notes:
- I'm a Windows user so I've never test it in Safari. I _should_ work fine though.
- It's not responsive. My intention was just to build a desktop app. If there is a need for responsiveness let me know and then I can work on it.
- The schema types are loosely sorted by usage. I looked at the last few schemas I built and tried to sort them according to the types that I used most often. If you have suggestions for a better order let me know.

### Guide:
Most of the app is self explanatory. I think with a minute of clicking around you will figure it all out. But I'll give you a quick crash course...

First, if you only need a bare bones template, click one of the blue buttons at the top to generate the code. Thats it. If you only need code for one schema type then follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, find the schema type that you need
2. Click the blue "Get This Type" button to generate the code with placeholder text
3. Highlight and copy the generated code in the right pane
4. Paste it into your section file

That's the basics. From there, try filling in some of the fields, like ID and Label, to customize the schema type.

To build an entire schema, check the "Add To Schema" box for all of the types that you need and then click one of the blue buttons in the right pane to generate the code for the whole schema.

Play around with some of the other fields and controls. Let me know if you need any help.

### Get Started:
You can clone the repo or you can download the zip file from the Download folder. Open index.html in a browser and check it out.

I hope this can be a useful tool for you. All feedback is welcome!
