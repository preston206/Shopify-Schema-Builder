# Shopify Schema Builder

Like the name implies, this app is for building Shopify Schemas. You can build individual schema types, like just a text or just an image_picker, or you can build an entire schema with as many types as you want.

### A Few Notes:
- This probably doesn't need to be mentioned, but just in case, it's built with modern Javascript so only the latest browsers should be used.
- As of 5/14/20 so far only tested on Chrome and Firefox for Windows.
- It's meant to be a desktop app, so there was no work done to make it responsive. If there is a need for that then we can work on it. It has our usual grid in place already so it wouldn't be too difficult.
- The schema types are loosely sorted by usage. I looked at the last few schemas I built and tried to sort it according to the ones I used most. If you have suggestions for a different order let me know.

### Guide:
Most of the app is self explanetory. I think with a couple minutes of clicking around you will figure it all out. But I'll give you a quick crash course...

Find the schema type that you need, like URL or Header, and then you can get the object with fake data or you can uncheck the "Use Fake Data" checkbox and get the object with empty strings. You can also fill in the fields and customize the object with the text that you want. There is also a Quantity field where you can enter the number of objects you want returned. For types with additional options, like range, select, or radio, there is another row where you can enter in custom data for things like min, max, and key-value pairs.

### Get Started:
You can clone the repo or you can download the zip file. Open index.html in a browser and check it out.

I hope this can be a useful tool for us. All feedback is welcome!
